# Increase-Storage
Simple script to expand a logical volume using unallocated space
This uses some basic user inputs and then will run the command to recursively expand a logical volume
Still trying to figure out how to have the if statement repeat if nothing is entered.....


Also, since i dont know how to have a script be elevated this needs to be ran with elevated priviledges
